# Adapter

In a microservices architecture, it is common for one microservice to communicate with another microservice through APIs. The Adapter design pattern can be a useful pattern in this context to facilitate communication between microservices that have different interfaces or data formats.

Here's how the Adapter pattern can be used in microservices communication:

1. Microservices with Different Interfaces: In a microservices architecture, each microservice might have its own API with specific methods and data formats. When one microservice needs to interact with another microservice, it may not have the same API interface. In such cases, an Adapter can be used to convert the request or response from one microservice to match the expected format of the other microservice.

2. Versioning and Backward Compatibility: As microservices evolve over time, their APIs might undergo changes. However, existing clients might still be using older versions of the APIs. To ensure backward compatibility, an Adapter can be employed to translate requests and responses between different API versions, allowing newer microservices to communicate with older ones seamlessly.

3. Protocol Transformation: Microservices may communicate over different protocols like HTTP, AMQP, or gRPC. If two microservices use different protocols, an Adapter can be used to translate messages between these protocols and enable communication between them.

4. Data Format Conversion: Microservices may exchange data in different formats, such as JSON, XML, or Protocol Buffers. An Adapter can handle the conversion between these formats, ensuring that data sent by one microservice is correctly understood by the receiving microservice.

5. Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms: When one microservice communicates with another, it may encounter errors or failures. An Adapter can handle error responses and implement retry mechanisms to ensure robust communication between microservices.

By using the Adapter pattern in microservices communication, it is possible to decouple the services and shield them from changes in each other's APIs. It also promotes a more modular and flexible design, allowing each microservice to evolve independently without breaking the communication with other microservices.

1. First classes that we can see on diagrams are Client and its interface. Which is represented as ModernApp and IModernApp.
The client houses the implementation of the existing business logic of the program. And client interface defines the 
set of behaviours that other classes must follow to be able to collaborate with the client code.
2. Service class in diagrams is represented by ModernUIService class. This is usually some thidr party or legacy code,
that the client can't use directly because it has an incompatible interface.
3. Adapter on the diagram represented by ModernUIServiceAdapter class. The adapter is a class that is able to work with both,
with the client and the service. It implements the client interface while wrapping the service object, it translates the client calls
into something that the wrapped service can understand and make use of.
4. In conclusion, Adapter pattern uses inheritance and composition to enable objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
Do to that, it creates a middle-layer class that serves as a translator. Also, this pattern applies the single responsibility and 
open-closed principles because the adapting behavior will be separated in its own class, and it gives the ability to introduce new 
types of adapters into the program.
